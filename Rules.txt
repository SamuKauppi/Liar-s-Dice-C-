RULES TO LIAR's DICE
- Each player starts with a cup that has 5 dice (number of dices can change)
- Each player can only see their own dices
- If player wins a round they get to remove one dice from their cup
- Winner is the player who has no dices left

Bidding
- On their turn, player can bid on how many copies are there in total of a single dice 
(For Example: there are 6 copies of the dice 4)
- Player can only bid for the same amount or higher than the previous.
(For Example: if previous player called 6 copies of 4, the current player can only call
 6 or higher count)
- When a player is bidding for the same count, they can't bid a lower or same dice value as the
previous player
- if the same count is called for an round, the starting player has to call higher count.

Calling
- On their turn, player can also call the previous player a liar 
- When called, all of the dice's are revealed and the total amount of a face is counted
- Dice face of 1 is wild and counts for every dice
- If there are less copies of the dice then the previous player bid for, the previous player
loses the round
- Winner of the round takes one dice from their cup and the bids are reset
